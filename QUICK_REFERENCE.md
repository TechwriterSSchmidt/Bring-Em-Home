## 📍 GPS Accuracy

| Conditions | Accuracy |
|------------|----------|
| Open field, 8+ sats | ±2m |
| Light trees, 6+ sats | ±5m |
| Forest, 4-5 sats | ±10-15m |
| Heavy forest/canyon | ±50m+ |

## 🔧 Calibrate Compass

1. Hold device level
2. Move in figure-8 pattern (30 sec)
3. Rotate in complete circle
4. Test against known direction

## 🌐 Understanding Coordinates

**Latitude**: North ↑ / South ↓ (-90 to +90)
- Positive = North of equator
- Negative = South of equator

**Longitude**: East → / West ← (-180 to +180)
- Positive = East of Prime Meridian
- Negative = West of Prime Meridian

## 🆘 If Lost and Device Fails

1. **STOP** - Don't wander
2. **THINK** - Where did you come from?
3. **OBSERVE** - Look for landmarks, trails
4. **PLAN** - Stay or self-rescue?
5. **SIGNAL** - Whistle, mirror, bright clothes

## 📐 Distance Units

- Less than 1 km: Shows in **meters** (m)
- Over 1 km: Shows in **kilometers** (km)

Example:
- `Distance: 850 m` = 850 meters
- `Distance: 2.45 km` = 2,450 meters

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Write down home coordinates** - backup if memory lost!
2. **Take photo of home location** - helps memory
3. **Mark waypoints on map** - cross-reference with GPS
